       "I love South Dakota. As long as you live in the more populated areas, it's fantastic. Good (but somewhat unpredictable) weather, relatively low cost of living (which is evened out by average to below average wages), solid economy (one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country - in my city, almost every high schooler has a job), and relatively inexpensive, but reputable universities - mine is 18k per year before financial aid.\\nDownside is that it's politically stagnant - SD hasn't voted for a Democrat in around fifty years, so nothing is changing, and outside the few cities we have are all relatively uneducated farmers or native Americans, who live on poor reservations. Hell, one of our reservations is essentially a third world country, literally the poorest area of the entire United States, or at least the poorest reservation. We just have a terrible past when it comes to Natives - the prejudice against them is still pretty strong in older generations.\\ntl;dr SD is pretty nice if you live in the cities.    1\n",
       "I love WA State. We have ocean, desert, mountains and rain forest. Climate is moderate, culture is progressive. Economy here is booming with tech and aerospace. Seattle is world arts center.

Pretty sweet life here overall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
